        <h2>About Our Company</h2>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conute introduces compatible commuters by matching them socially and logistically. Users enter profile information, such as whether they will be a driver, a passenger, or both, and enter logistical information- primarily their commuting schedule.  To save time and to improve their matches, users can signin with their Facebook, Linkedin, and/or Google Plus accounts and allow us access to their data, strictly for matching  purposes. (Alternatively a Conuter can fill out their profile and preference sheet manual, which we strongly encourage people to do.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Conute App defaults to the matching page where you can quickly browse through possible Conuters. If you are interested in connecting with the individual, you swipe right, if you are not interested swipe left, and if you are ambivalent swipe up. (The navigation page is opened by swiping down.) </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To expedite the matching process we run information through a proprietary matching algorithm to present Conuters with viable connections. Once you’ve expressed interest in another Conuter, your profile is brought to the front of their browsing queue. If they express interested in you by swiping right you are now ‘matched.’ Personal information, such as your last name, your phone number, and your approximate location  remain private, however you can begin an instant message conversation and approve to share this information when  and if you so desire.  </p>
       <br>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our business fosters:</p>

        <ul>
<li>Social Networking</li>
<li>Business Connections</li>
<li>Ridesharing and Carpooling</li>
